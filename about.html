                        <p>Hi! I'm Katherine, a Software Engineer based in NYC but 
                        open to relocating anywhere in the U.S. I'm a recent graduate 
                        from St. John's University where I recieved a B.A in Computer Science 
                        with a minor in Business Administration.</p>
                        <p>Although I completed my degree at St.John's I also previously attended Fordham's Gabelli School of Business
                        for two years working towards a B.A in Accounting/Finance before ultimately 
                        transfering to St.John's for Computer Science.  </p>
